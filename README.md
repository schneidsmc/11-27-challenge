## Description

This website organizes information regarding Horiseon and the service.

- The motivation for this project is to effectively display all Horiseon has to offer.
- This homework assignment was to evaluate the code and corectly label the HTML, CSS and README files.
- The assignment helped make the CSS and HTML more legible and efficient. 
- Comments were made in both the HTML and CSS to differentiate the content.
- This assignment taught me about HTML outlines and using the correct element selectors to differentiate the parts of the HTML. This helped align the element selectors with the classes and ids in the cascading style sheet.  
- The CSS was edited to reflect all the changes made to the HTML semantics.
- The site has been made responsive at the 992px and 768 breakpoints.

-This is a screenshot of the completed HTML. Element selectors were utilized to remove all div labels. This helped make the outline of the HTML clear and consise.
